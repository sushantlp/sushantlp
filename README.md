# Hello, nerds

I code on occasion, believe it or not. My latest deal is I'm making as many useful things with React and Next.js _as humanly possible_.

I love geopolitical and musicals. Also candy. I work at [Xelpmoc](https://www.xelpmoc.in/), too. If you would like to discuss these things, follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/whoami_k3rnel). You can also [ask me anything](https://github.com/sushantlp) (within reason).
